# Zodiac Sign Calculator

A simple C++ program that calculates your zodiac sign, element, and modality based on your birth date.

## Description

This project is a practice exercise to improve my C++ skills. The program prompts the user for their birth day and month, validates the input, and outputs the corresponding zodiac sign along with its elemental and modality characteristics.

---

## Features

- User input validation for day and month
- Zodiac sign determination based on birth date
- Outputs element and modality related to the sign
- Command-line interface with decorative output

---

## Currently Working On: v2.1

- Improving and debugging input validation

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/s-0-p-h-i-a/Zodiac_Calculator.git

2. Choose a version then compile the code using a C++ compiler:
    ```bash
   g++ zodiac_v2_1.cc -o zodiac_v2_1

4. Run the program:
      ```bash
    ./zodiac_v2_1

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your birth date.

## Learning Notes

This project helped me practice:

- Basic input and output in C++

- Conditional logic and switch statements

- Input validation techniques

- Code organization and readability

- Preparing for more advanced features like arrays and functions

---

## Future Improvements

- Modularize code with functions

- Use arrays or structs for better data handling

- Add error handling and input retries
