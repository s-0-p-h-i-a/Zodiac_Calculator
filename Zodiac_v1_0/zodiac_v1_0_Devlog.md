# Version 1.0

## Date

## Description

Initial version of the zodiac sign calculator implemented in a single `.cc` file. The goal was to build a working prototype using basic control structures, and to model real-life conceptual groupings like zodiac sign date ranges, elements, and modalities.

---
## Features

- Accepts user input for birth month and day

- Determines the correct zodiac sign based on date ranges

- Associates each sign with an element (e.g., fire, earth, air, water)

- Associates each sign with a modality (cardinal, fixed, mutable)

- Outputs zodiac sign, element, and modality to the user

---
## Approach

- Implemented with `if-else` chains to handle date range comparisons

- All data and logic contained in one file (`zodiac-v1.cc`)

- Focused on building a clean and readable structure using basic tools

- No use of arrays, functions, or header/implementation file separation yet

---
## What I Practiced

- Translating conceptual groupings (e.g., elements, modalities) into code

- Structuring conditionals for accurate and efficient date comparison

- Designing beginner-level programs with maintainable flow and clarity

---
## Notes

- Already familiar with `cin`, but reinforced experience with user input and type validation

- Started thinking about how to better organize logic for future scalability

---
## Next Steps

- Improve code modularity for maintainability (planned for v1.1)

- Explore functions and logical separation of concerns

- Begin experimenting with simple user interface improvements
